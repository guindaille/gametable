# GameTable

A multiplayer board game JS framework, build with:
- [SolidJS](https://github.com/solidjs/solid)
- [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
- [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)
- WebRTC

## Usage

Requires [bun package manager](https://bun.sh/). It is a replacement of `npm` which is (probably),
way faster.

```bash
$ bun install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```
